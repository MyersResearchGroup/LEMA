My program can be run by selecting the DBM2 radio button in the verification view.
The resulting files are a name.dot file and a name.txt file in the verification's standard folder
where name is the name of the name is the Verification ID.
In the subfolder TestFiles of the folder test, are a few test lpn files that I used for testing my
program.
